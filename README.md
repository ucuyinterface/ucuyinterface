Ucuy (Burhannudin) is an UI/UX Designer. He falls in love with Azusa Oribe (Akari Hayami) at first sight and they begin to date. 

One day, Azusa tells Ucuy "people who meet me, forget about me several hours later."

Ucuy doesn't believe Azusa, but by chance he realizes that he forgot about Azusa. So he won't forget Azusa, Ucuy begins to leave a note for himself and Azusa.
